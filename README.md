## About the Data
The data was collected from an online form, asking users information about their experience and employment in the Data Analytics field. The data was very messy and had to undergo extensive data cleaning prior to developing the visualizations, all of which was compleated within PowerBI.

This dashboard visualization provides many high level insights into the Survey Data, utilizing various PowerBI visulization tools to clearly showcase the data submitted into the form. The dashboard fulfills many purposes....
   - **Data Consolidating:** Aggregating various visuals into once unified view,
   - **Data Visualization:** Data presented in a visually appealing and easily understandable format to illustrate trends, patterns and insights
   - **Real-time Monitoring:** Tracking of important metrics and KPIs
   - **Interactivity:** Ability to interact with data with the use of slicers and filters
